## Can I download the resource pack?
You can't download the resource pack right now because it's in development. I'll post a release once I have some work done.

## How can I suggest food items?
You can open an issue [here](https://github.com/PanIntegralus/FoodPack/issues) with the following template:
- *Food item name:*
- *Food item base:*
- *Food item image (optional):*

## Will this resource pack be available for Bedrock Edition?
I hope so. Bedrock Edition resource pack system is somewhat different to Java Edition one, but I'll try my best to make this happen.

## Why does the food included in this resource pack have a different name?
The resource pack is using a trick to change the texture of existing items on the game to another ones. Only if you change your game's language to "English (US)" you will see the changed names.

## When will the resource pack be available to download?
I plan to release a testing version as soon as I have a decent number of foods included.
